BACKGROUND of EXPERIMENTS
==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

STEPS for EXECUTION in run_analysis.R
==================================================================
# STEP1. SETTING GLOBAL OPTIONS AND LOAD PACKAGES
# STEP2. READING ACTIVITY LABEL AND FEATURE FILES
# STEP3. READ TEST DATA WITH ACTIVITIES(USING ACTIVITY NAMES NOT ID) ,SUBJECTS, DATAs.
# STEP4. READ TRAIN DATA WITH ACTIVITIES(USING ACTIVITY NAMES NOT ID) ,SUBJECTS, DATAs.
# STEP5. BIND the test_data and train_data into data
# STEP6. Extracts only the measurements whose names end with mean() and std().
# STEP7. set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# STEP8. writing final_data as a txt file called "step5.txt"
